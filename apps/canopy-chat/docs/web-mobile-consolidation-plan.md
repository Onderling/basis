# canopy-chat — web↔mobile consolidation plan (remove the divergence)

*Created 2026-06-11, after a 3-agent deep-dive audit of web (`web/main.js` + `web/v2/circleApp.js`)
vs mobile (`apps/canopy-chat-mobile/src/screens/`) vs the shared `apps/canopy-chat/src/`.*

> **STATUS 2026-06-11 — the 4 duplicated pairs are now SHARED; the dedup goal is met.**
> Phase 0 SKIPPED (modules kept — tested, not dead). **Phase 1 ✅** web adopts `createFeedbackMount`
> (`12d27b14`). **Phase 2 ✅** shared `kringBroadcast` (`broadcastKringFanOut`+`kringChatMessageEvent`).
> **Phase 3 ✅** shared `makeCircleLookup` (mobile's live lookup → web). **Phase 4 ✅** one engine —
> `circleDispatch` is the core, `circleTurn` a thin adapter (`d1d35281`). All verified (suite 2296,
> web build, mobile device). **Phase 5 (web kring composer bot/feedback) is the only remainder — it's
> NET-NEW web feature work, not dedup.** Owed: 2 web browser smokes (P1 feedback, P3 `/done <label>`).

## The principle (the test of "done")
The intended model: **logic is written once in `src/` and both shells inject only platform adapters.**
A mobile screen should contain **RN UI + the transport/bundle adapter and nothing else** — every
dispatch/resolution/feedback/messaging decision should live in a shared `src/` module that web and
mobile both call. The bugs fixed this session (dispatch arity, `listOpen`→stoop, `/klaar` unreachable,
fan-out arg-shift) all lived in places where **mobile reimplemented** web's logic instead of sharing it.

## State (what the audit found)
- **Most substrates ARE shared** — ~78 modules re-exported via the `@canopy-app/canopy-chat` barrel and
  imported by both shells (router/dispatch/parser/renderer/thread, manifest projectors, gate, interpret,
  clarifyingDispatch/clarifyTargets, catch-up, kring receivers, deliveryState, feedbackSurface, the
  circle* model/content/stream/preview helpers, …). The divergence is **narrower than it looks**.
- **4 genuine duplicated-logic pairs** (one platform reimplements the other) — the targets below.
- **1 feature gap** — web's kring (GESPREK) composer has no bot/feedback (only plain fan-out); mobile's
  is unified. Mobile is *ahead* here.
- **2 dead modules** — `src/v2/circleLlmRoutes.js`, `src/v2/groupsIndex.js` (zero importers).
- Web has **no bug D** (`getActiveCircle()` → string) and caches `listOpen` (so `done X` resolves if
  the user listed tasks this session — cache, vs mobile's live fetch).

## The 4 divergences (verified, file:line)
| # | Web | Mobile | Why it diverged / risk |
|---|-----|--------|------------------------|
| 1 | `circleTurn.js` (bool return, "else"→defer-to-shell) | `circleDispatch.js` (`{via,cmd}`, "else"→postToKring) | Same gate→interpret→dispatch loop written twice; both headers admit it. Logic drift = the bug surface. |
| 2 | `resolveTextArgsInPlace` (`main.js:2063`, **cache** `lastListingFor`, no clarify) | `circleLookup` (`CircleLauncherScreen.js:1533`, **live** fetch, app-qualified, clarify+buttons) | Two inline resolvers; `clarifyTargets.js` is the intended shared form. Web slash silently no-ops on ambiguity; web can't resolve un-listed labels. |
| 3 | inline feedback glue in `handleUserText` (`main.js:~2216-2252`) + `createFeedbackSurface` direct | `createFeedbackMount` (wraps the surface) | Web's `/klaar` reaches the bot only *by accident* (unknown-slash bucket); `/help` (a real web cmd) would NOT reach the bot. Mount is robust. |
| 4 | `broadcastFanOut` (`circleApp.js:896`) | `broadcastFanOut` (`CircleLauncherScreen.js:1458`) | Near-identical bodies (only rerender vs `setDeliveryTick` differ). |

## Plan — sequenced (small/independent wins first, the big unify last)

Guardrails for EVERY phase: full canopy-chat vitest green (currently 2282); web build (`vite build`)
clean; mobile bundle loads (device or metro); no behaviour change unless explicitly the goal; commit
per phase on a dedicated branch.

### Phase 0 — dead-module cleanup *(trivial, do first)*
Delete `src/v2/circleLlmRoutes.js` + `src/v2/groupsIndex.js` (zero importers, verified across `apps/`
incl. tests). Confirm grep finds no references, run the suite.

### Phase 1 — web adopts `createFeedbackMount` *(small, self-contained, fixes a real bug)*
Replace web's inline `handleUserText` feedback block with `createFeedbackMount` (the shared wrapper
mobile already proves). Inject web's `appendUserBubble`/`appendBotBubble` (shell-message renderers) and
keep web's **real-pod activation** (`buildFeedbackPod` on `/feedback <code>`) as a pre-`start` hook the
mount calls. Fixes web's fragile `/klaar`//`/help` routing (the mount's `FEEDBACK_BOT_SLASH` is
explicit). Verify: web `/feedback → text → /klaar → /feedback-stop`; feedback suite green.

### Phase 2 — extract a shared `broadcastFanOut` + optimistic-append *(mechanical)*
Lift the fan-out body (optimistic→pending→sent/failed, retry-same-`msgId`,
`rawCallSkill('stoop','broadcastKringMessage',…)`) into a shared helper beside `deliveryState.js`,
injecting only the rerender/notify callback (web `rerender` / RN `setDeliveryTick`). Same for the
optimistic `chat-message` event builder. Delete both inline copies. Verify both shells still deliver +
mark status; the `recipient-pubkey-unknown` reporting stays intact.

### Phase 3 — unify label resolution on `clarifyTargets` *(medium; web gains a feature)*
Make `clarifyCommandTargets` (+ `createClarifyingDispatch`) the **single** arg-resolution path for both
the typed-slash AND the LLM path, on both platforms. Inject the **lookup source** per platform (web =
`lastListingFor` cache; mobile = `circleLookup` live fetch) — that's the legitimate adapter seam. Retire
web's `resolveTextArgsInPlace`. Web's typed slash then gains the clarification turn (candidate buttons)
it currently lacks, and the `appOrigin` app-qualification applies uniformly. Verify: web `/done <label>`
ambiguity → asks; unique → dispatches; mobile unchanged.

### Phase 4 — unify the orchestrator: one turn engine *(biggest; do after 1–3 prove the seam)*
Collapse `circleTurn.js` + `circleDispatch.js` into ONE platform-neutral `createCircleDispatch` whose
"everything else" is an injected `onUnhandled(text, ctx)` and whose result is a normalized
`{via, cmd}`. Web injects `onUnhandled = () => 'defer'` (and maps the result back to its boolean
"did the shell handle it?"); mobile injects `onUnhandled = postToKring`. The shared core already owns
gate/interpret/scope/addressesBot — only the shell glue differs. Back-compat: keep `circleTurn` as a
thin wrapper re-exporting the unified engine until web's call-site is migrated, then delete it. Verify:
web DM-shell circle bot + mobile kring bot identical behaviour; suite green.

### Phase 5 — close the web kring-composer feature gap *(feature work, optional/last)*
Web's GESPREK composer (`circleApp.js onSend`) only fans out plain messages; wire the unified turn
engine (Phase 4) + the feedback mount (Phase 1) into it so `@assistant …` and `/feedback` work *in the
kring view* on web, matching mobile. This is net-new web functionality, not just dedup — schedule
separately.

---

## After this
The mobile screens shrink to RN UI + the `bundle.callSkill` transport adapter; the web shells shrink to
DOM rendering + their dispatcher. Every circle-bot/feedback/kring decision lives in shared `src/`
modules, so the next change can't drift between platforms. This is the canopy-chat instance of the
broader **manifest-driven, write-once** direction (see `PLAN-manifest-gate-surfaces.md`,
`[[project-manifest-driven-surfaces-endgame]]`); a later pass can repeat the audit per app
(household/tasks/stoop/folio/calendar).
